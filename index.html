            <p>The year 2022 has come.Every year comes with a new opportunity to broaden our knowledge and learn
                something new.
                Sure,learning a new thing comes with it's own set of hardships.But isn't overcoming those hardship the
                thing that
                keeps us motivated?

            <h1>Without Limits</h1>
            <p>I think that developing has no ends.You can create and design in a thousand ways,but still not be able to
                make the 'perfect' website.
                Because if there was such a thing as a perfect website,I don't think there would be any needs for a
                profession such as web 'developing'.</p>

            <h1>|Help Each Other|</h1>
            <p>As fellow human beings,it's normal to share our knowledge with each other. the same applies to web
                developers.
                So,I think It's important to communicate with our fellow developers,so that if we can't do something on
                our own and need help with it,
                there can always be some one we can ask about it.After all,helping each other and sharing the things we
                know takes us one step closer to
                good developers. </p><br>

                Prevention
                Protect yourself and others around you by knowing the facts and taking appropriate precautions. Follow
                advice provided by your local health authority.
                Check with your local health authority for the most relevant guidance for your region.
                To prevent the spread of COVID-19:
                Maintain a safe distance from others (at least 1 metre), even if they don’t appear to be sick.
                Wear a mask in public, especially indoors or when physical distancing is not possible.
                Choose open, well-ventilated spaces over closed ones. Open a window if indoors.
                Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.
                Get vaccinated when it’s your turn. Follow local guidance about vaccination.
                Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze.
                Stay home if you feel unwell.
                If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention. Call in advance so your
                healthcare provider can direct you to the right health facility. This protects you, and prevents the
                spread of viruses and other infections.
                Masks
                Properly fitted masks can help prevent the spread of the virus from the person wearing the mask to
                others. Masks alone do not protect against COVID-19, and should be combined with physical distancing and
                hand hygiene. Follow the advice provided by your local health authority.</p><br>
