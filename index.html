            <p>The year 2022 has come.Every year comes with a new opportunity to broaden our knowledge and learn
                something new.
                Sure,learning a new thing comes with it's own set of hardships.But isn't overcoming those hardship the
                thing that
                keeps us motivated?

            <h1>Develop</h1>
            <h1>Without Limits</h1>
            <p>I think that developing has no ends.You can create and design in a thousand ways,but still not be able to
                make the 'perfect' website.
                Because if there was such a thing as a perfect website,I don't think there would be any needs for a
                profession such as web 'developing'.</p>

            <h1>|Help Each Other|</h1>
            <p>As fellow human beings,it's normal to share our knowledge with each other. the same applies to web
                developers.
                So,I think It's important to communicate with our fellow developers,so that if we can't do something on
                our own and need help with it,
                there can always be some one we can ask about it.After all,helping each other and sharing the things we
                know takes us one step closer to
                good developers. </p><br>
